Notes:	1)	Please view this file through KISS-C to see in proper format
		2)	*  = Ask Ross about this
			** = Asked Ross + Problem is fixed
		3)	In Genral, if you dont understand something, then DO NOT CHANGE IT; the most you should do in this case is to comment it out, work around it, and/or ask somebody who knows better later

001	04-09	21:10	McGee, JM	Began to integrate Ross libraries into our Code.  Ross files are to be named "ross.FILENAME.h".  DO NOT modify them without BOTH recording your changes AND
									saving a copy of the pre-modified file.  Also added files with lists of function declarations.
002	04-10	13:53	''			Consolidated list of function defintions of Ross libraries- the ones I found immediately relevant- into one file, "ross.Declarations.h".  Each library file has a
									section in Declarations file that is inlcuded if the relevant file is included.  Each section of the declarations file is surrounded by definition guards to ensure
									that it is compliled once and only once.
003	''		14:30	''			Uncommented a bunch of functions from both Declarations and their container lib files because they were declared/defined with conflicting parameters in an automatically
									included file, often "%INST_PATH%\targets\gcc\mingw\include\math.h"
004	''		''		''			*For some reason the "int max(...)" and "int min(...)" functions do not work.  Not really sure why but I just uncommented them.
005	''		''		''			*Last problem in "ross.Math.h". For some reason the global declarations on lines 32-36 generate a weird error that Ive never seen before:
									"inializer element is not constant". It might be because the defintions include calls to functions, this may not be allowed in C89.	For now Im just going to change
									them to defines.
006	''		3:50	''			*Line92 in "ross.Motors.h", I commented out setMotorPosition because set_motor_postition_counter(...) is no longer vaild in the current implementation of KISS-C
									Accordingly, I also changed "return setMotorPosition(port, 0L);"(84) to "clear_motor_position_counter(port); return get_motor_position_counter(port);"(84-45)
007	''		6:10	''			I have finished formatting Rosss following *.ic files: Circles, Boolean, Config, Math, Motors, Random, Servo, Vector, Wheels, Metrics, and Buttons.  I will now change
									the version from 4.3 to 4.4 as I begin to integrate Rosss funciots into our code
